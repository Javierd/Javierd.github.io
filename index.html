  					Hi, my name is Javier Delgado, more known in some forums as Javierd, and I am an computer/programming enthusiast from Spain who was born in 1998.<br> <br>

					I am currently studying a double degree on Maths and Computer Engineering at the UAM (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) while developing my own proyect on <a href="https://explorerbyx.org" target="_blank" class="link"> Explorer </a>, a startup incubator. At the moment, I have worked with several programming languages such as C, Java, Python and bash, I have got some knowledges of android development (ROMs and apps), Linux and Arduino, and a basic handling of Photoshop and web design.<br><br>

					As a demostration of all my knowledges, you have this website that I have build myself from the scratch. You can also see some of the things I've done in the <a href="#projects" class="link">projects</a> section. <br><br>

					<b>IIFYM is an Android app that allows you to track all your eaten foods and your weight in order to achieve faster a fittest and healthier body.</b><br><br>
					Every food is composed of three major macronutrients, carbohydrates, proteins and fats, which are essential for our body. This application will calculate the necessary amount of each macronutrient depending on your gender, age, height, weight and level of physical activity, and you'll be able to record all of your meals (by looking them up on the internet or creating them), in order to achieve your fitness goals, and significantly improve your health.
					<br><br>
					It will also allow you to keep a record of your weight and body fat percentage, attaching photos of your physical state, visible only from the app, to easily observe and share your progress.
					<br><br>
					And finally, it also has a social component, allowing you to share animations of your progress and the goals you achieve thanks to this app.
					<br><br>
					You can download the app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.javierd.iifym" target="_blank" class="link">here</a>
